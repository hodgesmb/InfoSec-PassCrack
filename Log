Password Cracking
Part I (80 points)
Suppose you have acquired a password hash file with only one hash value “de80593878cb1673c62a7f338dc7e4e1”, and you are asked to use dictionary attack to crack this password. You are told that the password associated with this hash was created using only lower case English letters and the hash function used is MD5 with no salt.
You are not allowed to use any existing password cracking tools, and therefore you will need to write your own code.
You can download a common password dictionary from the internet. Common dictionary may contain 1 million to 4 million commonly used passwords. Search online to find common dictionaries.
Use your own program to perform a dictionary attack against the above hash. Place a counter for dictionary words hashed and time your actual attack.
Log your project design and development on the following pages. (10 points)
Submit logs, all source code, instructions of how to compile and run your code, link to dictionary used, and all other relevant documents. (50 points)
Team presents your work in the last week of class
PowerPoint slides (10 points)

Part II (bonus 30 points)
Write a program to perform an Exhaustive Key Search attack over a password hash “b4220cfc4b4f08ba7608956989597fd5”.
